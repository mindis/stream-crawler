Twitter/GNIP Stream API Connector
=================================

Version 1.2 (initial public release)

This API connector was created to work with the Twitter stream API and store
the data locally for later analysis. It has been adapted to work with GNIP as
well. You will need user names and passwords or tokens and secrets from the
corresponding services to make this tool work.

The maven build process (````maven package````) creates a single executable
jar file that contains all dependencies. Running it is as simple as:

````
java -jar stream-crawler-1.2.jar crawler-twitter.xml
````

If you want to acquire access tokens from Twitter easily, just run the
authorize-user.scala script from the scripts directory after you have
requested a consumer key and token (needs to be set in the script).

The crawler has a management interface that allows you to reconfigure it by
sending a modified configuration xml.

It has been in use at [streamdrill](https://streamdrill.com) for quite a while
and worked continuously for a very long time. It is very robust and will
automatically reconnect to the stream if it is disconnected (with backoff).

It is most useful in conjunction with the [stream-proxy](https://github.com/streamdrill/stream-proxy),
which provides a simple way to retrieve the acquired data without having to
connect to the original source multiple times.
